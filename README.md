# EDA-and-Feature-Engineering-with-Seaborn-and-XgBoost
Using UCI's Breast Cancer Dataset(data.csv) 

SAMPLE EXPERIMENTATION PROJECT TO TEST OUT DIFFERENT FEATURE SELCECTION METHODS

1.) I have performed EDA sequentially using Seaborn and provided all insights and explanations parallely.

2.) Have also shown 4 methods of optimal Feature Selection using XgBoost:Correlation study,Chi Squared Test,Recursive Feature Elimination using CV and PCA.All this is inlcuded in EDA_FULL_GITHUB.ipynb notebook.
